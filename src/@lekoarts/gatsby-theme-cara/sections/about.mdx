## About

> Throughout my career I've worked closely with enterprise SaaS clients and internal stakeholders to drive increased ROI by building and launching data products across numerous platforms and environments.

These have included API-first viewability and fraud prevention integrations with the largest buying platforms within the digital advertising ecosystem, as well as highly bespoke and first-in-market measurement integrations with social platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest.

I enjoy working on cutting-edge technology solutions to achieve business goals, and I particularly focus on the need to distill in-the-weeds concepts into layman's terms for go-to-market teams and non-technical audiences.

As a data analysis and coding junkie, I've taught myself multiple languages (Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript) as well as services, tools, and frameworks (AWS, Hugging Face, Streamlit, and Retool) in order to further my professional and personal development.

I've used this experience to develop apps ranging from the Podcast Summarizer (using large language models to summarize podcast episodes and YouTube videos) to the Tether Insolvency Calculator (interactively displaying a hypothetical portfolio for the world's largest cryptocurrency stablecoin) and the Fed Project (analyzing the Federal Reserve's interest rate projections over time).
