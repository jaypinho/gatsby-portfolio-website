## About me

> I'm passionate about creating great products that solve hard problems.

I believe the best outcomes result from open collaboration â€” between product and engineering, of course, but also via frequent interactions with clients and prospects, go-to-market teams, the C-suite, and anyone else with curiosity and a drive to help create best-in-class software solutions.

My career has spanned everything from Series A-stage tech startups to sprawling, 150,000-person organizations. The startups I've joined were acquired (twice!) for over $1.2 billion collectively. Throughout this period, I've particularly enjoyed learning to translate in-the-weeds concepts into layman's terms for non-technical audiences.

My professional background is concentrated in launching large-scale technical products. As the head of brand safety product management, I led an international team of PMs to build best-in-class contextual data products that generated millions in revenue within their first three years. These included API-first viewability and fraud prevention integrations with the largest buying platforms in the digital advertising ecosystem, as well as highly bespoke and first-in-market measurement integrations with marquee social platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest.

I like getting my hands dirty: I've leveraged my technical curiosity to teach myself multiple languages -- Ruby on Rails, Python, and JavaScript -- and launch a wide variety of apps (see above projects), and I'm comfortable using a broad variety of cloud services, tools, and frameworks (AWS, Hugging Face, Streamlit, and Retool, for example) in a wide swathe of applications ranging from audio analysis to LLM fine-tuning.

I'm always up for a chat!
